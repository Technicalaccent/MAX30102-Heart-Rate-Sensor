MAX30102 Heart Rate Sensor


How accurate is MAX30102?

A study conducted by IJEECS suggests that the accuracy rate of the MAX30102 measurement is 97.11% and 98.84%, for heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2), respectively. Bland Altman was used to appraising and visualizing the agreement between the two measurement devices.


Is MAX30102 FDA approved?

The chip acts as an integrated pulse oximetry and heart-rate monitor sensor solution. It should be noted that the MAX30102 is not an FDA-approved medical device and it's recommended to use for only small-scale projects.


What is a SpO2 sensor?

Pulse oximeters, also called SpO2 sensors, are used to measure blood oxygen levels or oxygen saturation in your blood. In the medical field, pulse oximeters are usually small devices that resemble a clip.
